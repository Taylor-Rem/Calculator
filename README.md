# Calculator
This was one of my first big JavaScript challenges. I ran into some small issues that caused big trouble along the way when coding this calculator. One of the issues was that my display wasn't updating when I input the numbers. After some painstaking troubleshooting and checking the console, I figured out the problem was my value of "this.currentOperand" was undefined, so by adding "this.currentOperand = ''" to my "chooseOperation(operation){}" value I fixed my problem. A small issue that taught me the value of the skill that is troubleshooting. I chose to add this project to my github in memory of that troubleshooting issue.
